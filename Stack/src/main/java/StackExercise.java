/**
 * Stacks are LIFO - last in, first out, like a stack of plates or books, or the puzzle game "Towers of Hanoi".
 * They are used in algorithms where it is needed to keep track of the ordering in which the elements were inserted.
 *
 * ArrayDeque fills the role of *both* queues and stacks. You could think of a Deque as a deck of cards (pronounced the
 * same) where you could remove cards from either the top or bottom. You can use ArrayDeque
 * to perform stack operations. You can read about ArrayDeque in the official Javadocs here:
 * https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ArrayDeque.html
 * And you can read about the stack class here (deque exhibits the same behavior as Stack and contains the same
 * methods): https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Stack.html
